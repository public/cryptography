        key associated with this EC private key.

    .. attribute:: private_value

        :type: int

        The private value.

    .. method:: private_key(backend)

        Convert a collection of numbers into a private key suitable for doing
        actual cryptographic operations.

    .. method:: public_key(backend)

        Convert a collection of numbers into a public key suitable for doing
        actual cryptographic operations.

        :param backend: A
            :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.backends.interfaces.EllipticCurveBackend`

Elliptic Curve Signature Algorithms
-----------------------------------

.. class:: ECDSA(algorithm)
    .. versionadded:: 0.5

    The ECDSA signature algorithm first standardized in NIST publication
    `FIPS 186-3`_, and later in `FIPS 186-4`_.

    :param algorithm: An instance of a
        :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.interfaces.HashAlgorithm`
        provider.

    .. doctest::

        >>> from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
        >>> from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
        >>> from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import ec
        >>> private_key = ec.generate_private_key(
        ...     ec.SECT283K1(), default_backend()
        ... )
        >>> signer = private_key.signer(ec.ECDSA(hashes.SHA256()))
        >>> signer.update(b"this is some data I'd like")
        >>> signer.update(b" to sign")
        >>> signature = signer.finalize()

Elliptic Curves
---------------

All named curves are providers of
:class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primtives.interfaces.EllipticCurve`.

There is `some concern`_ that the non-Koblitz NIST curves (identified by names
that start with "B" or "P") may have been intentionally weakened by their
generation process.
